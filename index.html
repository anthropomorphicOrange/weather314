            Los Angeles has a two-season Mediterranean climate of dry summer and very mild winter, but it receives less annual precipitation than most other Mediterranean climates, so it is near the boundary of a semi-arid climate, though narrowly missing it. 
            Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 °F (20 °C) giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures. 
            Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.

        <p class="description-Link"> 
                  
            Located in the Great Plains far from the moderating influence of mountains or large bodies of water, Lincoln has a highly variable four season humid continental climate: winters are cold and summers are hot. With little precipitation during winter, precipitation is concentrated in the warmer months, when thunderstorms frequently roll in, often producing tornadoes. 
            Snow averages 26.0 inches (66 cm) per season. Snow tends to fall in light amounts, though blizzards are possible.  
            The average window for freezing temperatures is October 7 thru April 25, allowing a growing season of 164 days.

        <p class="description-NY"> 
                  
            New York City features a humid subtropical climate and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. 
            The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates. 
            The city is defined as having an oceanic climate.  

            Temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter, yet can also reach 60 °F (16 °C) for several days even in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. 
            Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 77.5 °F (25.3 °C) in July.
