            Los Angeles has a two-season Mediterranean climate of dry summer and very mild winter, but it receives less annual precipitation than most other Mediterranean climates, so it is near the boundary of a semi-arid climate, though narrowly missing it. 
            Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 °F (20 °C) giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures. 
            Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.

       The winters are cold and summers are hot. With little precipitation during winter, precipitation is concentrated in the warmer months, when thunderstorms frequently roll in, often producing tornadoes. 
       Snow averages 26.0 inches (66 cm) per season but seasonal accumulation has ranged from 7.2 in (18 cm) in 1967–1968 to 55.5 in (141 cm) in 2018-2019. Snow tends to fall in light amounts, though blizzards are possible. 
       There is an average of 38 days with a snow depth of 1 in (2.5 cm) or more.

        <p class="description-NY"> 
                  
        The climate of New York is continental, with cold winters and hot summers.
        The city is located in the eastern United States, at almost 41 degrees north latitude, on the edge of a continent that cools down in winter and heats up in summer, and where different air masses collide: the cold ones coming from Canada and the warm ones coming from the Gulf of Mexico. 
        In the Central Park Weather Station, the daily average temperature ranges from 0.8 °C (33.4 °F) in January to 25.3 °C (77.5 °F) in July. Here are the average temperatures.
