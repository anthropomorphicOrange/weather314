        <p class="description-NY"> 
                  
        The climate of New York is continental, with cold winters and hot summers.
        The city is located in the eastern United States, at almost 41 degrees north latitude, on the edge of a continent that cools down in winter and heats up in summer, and where different air masses collide: the cold ones coming from Canada and the warm ones coming from the Gulf of Mexico. 
        In the Central Park Weather Station, the daily average temperature ranges from 0.8 °C (33.4 °F) in January to 25.3 °C (77.5 °F) in July. Here are the average temperatures.
